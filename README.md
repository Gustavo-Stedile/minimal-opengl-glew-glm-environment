<h1>minimal OpenGL/GLEW/GLM environment</h1>

A basic environment for modern OpenGL development with GLEW on 64-bit Windows<br />

### `prerequisites:`

```bash
mingw-w64 # or any 64-bits GNU for windows
```

### `how to run:`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gustavo-Stedile/minimal-opengl-glew-glm-environment.git
cd minimal-opengl-glew-glm-environment
make run # or however your makefile binary is called
```

### `cautions:`
you need to be well assured that all those packages are compatible with 64-bit environments, as some libraries may crash your code if you messed up that

### `where to find those packages:`
<ul>
  <li>GLM: https://github.com/g-truc/glm</li>
  <li>GLFW: https://www.glfw.org/</li>
  <li>GLEW: https://glew.sourceforge.net/</li>
</ul>
